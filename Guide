    Egyptian hieroglyphs are the formal writing system of the Ancient Egyptians. 
    These combine logographic,  syllabic and alphabetic elements with a total of some 1,000 distinct characters. 
    There are also some signs which look the same but the meaning of it is according to the context and can be interpreted in diverse ways.
    It also makes it harder to decipher some hieroglyphs but sometimes it can be worth it the time spent to decipher the complete message
