* This game is based on the history of King Khufu and its pyramid during the Ancient Egypt but also about some general culture of the ancient egyptians.
  A great amount of researches were done to have enough knowledge to create the whole story as close as possible to the reality just with a few other inspirations.

# Automatic Game Mode
Not implemented

# Documentation with jazzy
Not implemented
we tried to use Jazzy to generate a documentation based on the comments.
Since none of us was working under MacOS and we didn't manage to install it on
Linux, we have just added comments to the code.
